Awareness project about inclusive education for children and youth with disabilities using visual design.

## Project Idea  

**Ma‘een** is an academic awareness project that aims to simplify and present the concept of an **educational virtual application** that serves children and youth with disabilities (hearing impairment, visual impairment, autism, learning difficulties).  

The project focuses on creating a **comprehensive graphic campaign** that includes:  
- Building a clear **brand identity** (logo, colors, typography, style guide).  
- Producing **visual communication materials** (posters, brochures, social media carousels, merchandising).  
- Designing **complementary educational products** (flash cards, activity book, puzzle/mockups).  

This project transforms complex educational and accessibility ideas into **visual messages** that help the community understand the importance of inclusion and accessible learning tools.
